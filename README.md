# Alfred Workflow for Airpods Pro Transparency and Active Noise Cancellation (ACN) modes
Alfred workflow to switch between your AirPods Pro Transparency and ACN mode with just one command from any macOS computer.

## Set-up
#### AirPods name
In order for the workflow to work, you need to put your Airpods **exact name** in the environment variable `AIRPODS_NAME` so the workflow can work for you!

Be careful to not mistake the character `'` and `â€™`! Only the latter will work.

#### Volume Control
You also need to make sure to have the Volume Control in your menu bar since the workflow simulates the mouse clicks of a regular user. Here is how to do it: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchl1f98810b/mac

## Run
