# Alfred Workflow for Airpods Pro Transparency and Active Noise Cancellation (ACN) modes
Alfred workflow to switch between your AirPods Pro Transparency and ACN mode with just one command from any macOS computer.

## Set-up
In order for the workflow to work, you need to put your Airpods **exact name** in the environment variable `AIRPODS_NAME` so the workflow can work for you!

Be careful to not mistake the character `'` and `â€™`! Only the latter will work.

## Run
Simply type "switch" to switch between the Transparency and ACN modes.

Feel free to make any contribution to this workflow by submitting Pull Requests or letting me know directly of a possible feature request.
